            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>STEAMHers is a nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering women in Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics (STEAM). Founded by Shreya Baronia and Maider Escobar, STEAMHers aims to create a supportive community for women to thrive in traditionally male-dominated fields.</p>
            <p>Our mission is to provide educational resources, mentorship, and networking opportunities to women and girls of all ages. We believe that by fostering a collaborative environment, we can inspire the next generation of female leaders in STEAM.</p>
            <p>We offer a variety of programs including online courses, workshops, competitions, and summer programs. These initiatives are designed to build confidence, enhance skills, and promote gender equality in STEAM fields.</p>
            <p>Our vision is a world where women are equally represented in all areas of STEAM, contributing their unique perspectives and talents to drive innovation and progress.</p>
            <h3>Why We Started</h3>
            <p>The founders of STEAMHers, Shreya Baronia and Maider Escobar, both experienced challenges and discrimination in STEAM fields due to their gender. Shreya often felt alienated in male-dominated environments, while Maider recognized the necessity of creating opportunities for women in areas where there were few opportunities for them to drive meaningful change. Together, they launched STEAMHers to combat these issues and to create a platform where women can thrive and support each other.</p>
            <h3>Our Sponsors</h3>
            <p>We are grateful to our sponsors who make our programs possible. Their support helps us provide quality education and resources to women around the world.</p>

                    <p>Through previous experiences in STEAM teams, I faced alienation and struggled to connect with the boys who would talk amongst themselves. To encourage more women to join and offset the large male influence in STEAM, I founded this organization with Maider.</p>

                    <p>During my lifetime, I have learnt that women are pioneers, innovators and leaders. However, many women in STEAM remain unrecognised. In order to change this, I created STEAMHers with Shreya to empower women, celebrate their achievements and ensure their voices are heard.</p>
